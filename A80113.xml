            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But when in a politique and worldly reſpect, he taſted the ſame ſower grape, which ſet his Fathers teeth on edge. Firſt a young Jeſuite ſtrooke him on the mouth, and then a Popiſh Rabſeka ſtabbed him to the heart.

            <p> To inſtance in a particular, not unfit for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, wee have not heard of any Proteſtant King that ever marryed with a contrary Religion, ſince the laſt <hi>Henrie of Navar</hi> with the beſt <hi>Marie of France,</hi> which marriage was ſo unfortunate to the Parties, having never Iſſue, and being afterwards, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>If therefore wee ever live, or are led by example, or precept, we ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Injunction, the Reaſon, and the effect are laid down in <hi>Deutronomie</hi> to the Jewes, that they ſhould not take any daughters of the neighbouring Nations (though greater and mightier then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) to be wives for their Sons, to turn from God and ſerve other Gods, then will the Lord waxe hot againſt them, and deſtroy them ſuddenly.</p>
            <p>All which are verified in <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wiſeſt King that ever was, who married one of the greateſt Kings daughters that then was, yet we ſee the weakeſt Sex withdrew the wiſeſt man. So <hi>Sollomon</hi> became an

And now wee have ſeen the danger and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of matching with ſtrangers, ſo if we diſcend to our Books of Chronicles, we ſhall find that God hath croſt if not curſt our Allyance and Aſſociation with forrein Nations. The Prince of the greateſt performance that this Kingdom or Chriſtendome ever had, was the black Prince, yet our Chronicles Record, that going into Spain to ſettle <hi>Don Pedro</hi> in that Kingdom, beſides the monſtrous ingratitude and perfidiouſneſſe of the Spanyard, who fayled in the performance of thoſe Conditions he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, which cauſed the miſerable Revolt in <hi>France</hi> to the loſſe of our Inheritance, the Prince was poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned in that Country, that he never had his health af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to come neerer to our own times, all the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages for the laſt 130. years (except the ſeverall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Marriages of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and our Gracions King that now is) have bin with Spaine, and with how little good the Succeſſe ſhewes, Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> marryed with the Spaniſh Kings Daughter, and God took him away ſuddenly without Iſſue.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Hewrie</hi> afterwards marryed with the ſame Daughter, and God tooke away all the Male Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this Match, and left only a Daughter, in whoſe ſhort Reign was ſhed more bloud for the true Religion then for the falſe ever ſince.</p>
            <p>Then Queen <hi>Marie</hi> marryed with Spain, which was ſo diſcontenting to the People, that it cauſed <hi>Wyats</hi> Rebellion, &amp; ſo diſcomfortable to the Queen
<pb facs="tcp:156143:5"/> that it broke her heart, ſo diſhonorable to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that meerly for that cauſe we loſt <hi>Callis</hi> in few days, which had bin above twenty years in our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, ſo that we may ſee that whatſoever the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or neceſſites of the Crowne bee, it will find more ſupport by caſting it ſelfe into the Armes of the Subjects, which are the two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then by ſeeking to any forreign Foe, or Envious Enemy, wherunto whenſoever we leave and truſt, we ſhall find the Egyptian Reeds, and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, rather to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant then to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us.</p>
